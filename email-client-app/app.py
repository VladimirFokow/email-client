# Insert this to the log in form: 

# Due to security reasons, email providers do not allow to use your main email 
# password to log into your account with third-party email clients (like this one)
# (They are afraid that the third-party email clients won't be able to protect it from the hackers. 
# If the hackers obtained your password - they could change it and you would lose access to your account forever!). 
# So to solve this, the email providers can generate a special password for third-party apps that doesn't allow to change your main password. 
# So even if the hackers obtain this special password, they won't be able to change your main password, 
# so you will not loose access to your account.

# So to log in here: 
# enable IMAP in your main provider, and generate and use your special password. Here are the instructions: 
# # ukr.net
# https://mail.ukr.net/desktop#security/appPasswords

# # gmail.com
# Sending: 
# if no 2FA set up - outdated method. If you don't have 2FA set up, set it up, and use the second approach. (outdated method: enable less secure apps, and use the main password: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)
# if 2FA is set up - use the generated password: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833

# Receiving: just ? enable IMAP (POP?), and use your normal password? can use the generated?
# Step 1: Check that IMAP is turned on: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?hl=en#zippy=%2Cstep-check-that-imap-is-turned-on
# https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop
# 
# TODO: add pop support

# Note about security of your password with this email client:
# It does't export your password outside of the app.
# If you're worried, you can delete your special password right right after you are done,
# and you check the actual code of this email client on github:
